      <p>C# is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework. The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version of C# 12, was released in November 2023.</p>
      <p>It is very versitile being used within Mobile applications, Desktop applications, Web applications
and plenty others. It's one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
C# is also quick to learn and simple to use and it has huge amount of community support.</p>

        <p>C++ is a cross-platform programming language for developing high-performance applications. Bjarne Stroustrup created C++ as an extension to the C programming language. It also gives programmers a lot of power over the system's memory and resources. C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Today's operating systems, graphical user interfaces, and embedded systems all contain it.</p>

        <p>It's an object-oriented programming language that offers programs a logical framework, and allows code to be reused, reducing development expenses. C++ is a portable programming language that may be used to create applications that run on a variety of systems.</p>

        <header>C# Syntax</header>

        <p><span class='syntax-using'>Using:</span> A using declaration is a variable declaration preceded by the using keyword. It tells the compiler that the variable being declared should be disposed at the end of the enclosing scope.</p>

        <p><code>using: system</code></p>

        <p><span class='syntax-curly-braces'>The curly braces {}</span> marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.</p>

        <p><span>Namespace</span> keyword is used to declare a scope that contains a set of related objects. You can use a namespace to organize code elements and to create globally unique types.</p>

        <code>using system<br>

          namespace Hello World

{ Line of code... }</code>

      </section>

        <header>Variables</header>

        <p>One of the most important things to know is Datatypes. Each datatype provides a different purpose and function. <br>There is 5 different datatypes to know:

          <ul id='datatype'>

          <li><span class='datatype-int'>int</span>: stores whole numbers, positive or negative</li>

          <li><span class='datatype-float'>float</span>: numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals.</li>

          <li><span class='datatype-bool'>bool</span>: Boolean values are mostly used for conditional testing and can only hold the value of true or false.</li>

          <li><span class='datatype-charset'>char</span>: used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes.</li>

          <li><span>string</span>: used to store a sequence of characters. String values must be surrounded by double quotes.</li>

          </ul>

          </p>

        <p>In order to declare a variable you must specify a type, give it a name of your and then assign it a value. The equal sign is what you would use to assign a value.</p>

        <code class='variable-example'>type variableName = value;</code>

        <p><span>For example: </span><code class='string-example'>string name = "John";</code></p>

      <section class='main-section' id='Method_and_Classes'>

        <header>Method and Classes</header>

        <p><span class='method-and-class-method'>Method</span> is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. They are used to avoid repetition of code, making it more maintainable and readable. They can also improve the structure of a program, and reduce the time and memory it takes to execute. A program calls a method to execute the statements it contains, specifying any required arguments. Methods can receive one or more values as inputs, and can return one or more values when they finish.</p>

        <p><span class='method-and-class-class'>Class</span> is a data structure that may contain data members (constants and fields), function members (methods, properties, events, indexers, operators, instance constructors, finalizers, and static constructors), and nested types. Class types support inheritance, a mechanism whereby a derived class can extend and specialize a base class.</p>

        <code class='class-example'>class Program

  

    static void Main(string[] args)

    {

      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");    

    }</code>
